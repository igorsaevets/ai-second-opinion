selftest.py - does this harness BEHAVE correctly? Costs nothing; calls no vendor.

    python selftest.py            # all suites
    python selftest.py --quiet    # only the summary line

doctor.py answers "is my machine set up?". This answers "does the code still do what it
promises?" - which is the question that matters after an edit, an upgrade, or an AI-suggested
fix. Every check here exists because the corresponding behaviour broke at least once.

The three properties under test are the ones a user actually depends on:

  1. PARTIAL INSTALLS ARE NORMAL. Missing API key, missing CLI, missing both - the run must
     continue with whatever is left and say plainly what is unavailable. Never a traceback.
  2. "ONLY THESE MODELS" MUST BE OBEYED EXACTLY, including through aliases and free-text
     routing, and a contradiction must stop rather than guess.
  3. NOTHING SECRET-SHAPED MAY REACH THE CONSOLE, THE RUN LOG, OR diagnostics.json.

Exit 0 = all passed.
